# KPMG Data Analytics Virtual Internship

## Introduction

In this project, we worked with Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, a medium-sized bikes and cycling accessories organization, in collaboration with Tony Smith (Partner) from KPMG’s Lighthouse & Innovation Team. Sprocket Central Pty Ltd expressed interest in learning more about KPMG’s expertise in its Analytics, Information & Modelling team. The project is divided into three tasks:

## Task 1: Data Quality Assessment
In this task, the team assessed the quality and completeness of three datasets provided by the client:

1. **Customer Demographic:** This dataset likely contains information about the characteristics of the customers, such as age, gender, income, etc.
2. **Customer Addresses:** This dataset likely includes the addresses of the customers.
3. **Transactions Data:** This dataset covers transactions made by customers in the past three months.

The goal of this task was to perform preliminary data exploration, identify any data quality issues, and enhance the quality of the provided data. This step is crucial to ensure that the subsequent analyses are based on accurate and reliable information.

## Task 2: Data Insights
This task focused on identifying high-value customers based on their demographics and attributes. The approach taken involved a PowerPoint presentation that outlined the recommended steps for the project. The project scope spanned three weeks and comprised three phases:

1. **Data Exploration:** Understanding the distributions and patterns within the data.
2. **Model Development:** Building analytical models to predict customer behavior.
3. **Interpretation:** Analyzing model results and deriving meaningful insights.

The detailed approach encompassed activities such as data distribution analysis, feature engineering, data transformation, model creation, interpretation of results, and reporting of findings.

## Task 3: Data Insights and Presentation
For this task, the team used visualizations to present the findings. They created a Power BI dashboard that summarized the data and showcased the results of the analysis. The presentation addressed key business questions, including:

1. **Trends:** Identification of trends in the underlying data.
2. **Customer Segmentation:** Identifying customer segments with the highest customer value.
3. **Recommendations:** Proposing marketing and growth strategies tailored to Sprocket Central Pty Ltd.

The Power BI dashboard and presentation materials were likely used to communicate the insights and recommendations effectively to the client.

this KPMG Data Analytics Virtual Internship provided participants with hands-on experience in working on real-world data analytics projects. The tasks covered data quality assessment, insights generation, and effective data visualization and presentation. The project's focus on enhancing business decisions using data-driven insights aligns with KPMG's expertise in analytics, information, and modeling.
