# KPMG Data Analytics Virtual Internship

## Introduction

In this project, we worked with Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, a medium-sized bikes and cycling accessories organization, in collaboration with Tony Smith (Partner) from KPMG’s Lighthouse & Innovation Team. Sprocket Central Pty Ltd expressed interest in learning more about KPMG’s expertise in its Analytics, Information & Modelling team. The project is divided into three tasks:

## Task 1: Data Quality Assessment

In this task, we assessed the quality and completeness of three datasets provided by the client:

- Customer Demographic
- Customer Addresses
- Transactions data from the past 3 months

Our goal was to prepare the data for analysis by performing preliminary data exploration and identifying opportunities to enhance the quality of Sprocket Central Pty Ltd’s data.

## Task 2: Data Insights

In this task, we focused on targeting high-value customers based on customer demographics and attributes. Our approach began with a PowerPoint presentation outlining the recommended steps. The client agreed on a 3-week scope, comprising three phases: Data Exploration, Model Development, and Interpretation. Our detailed approach included activities such as understanding data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modeling, results interpretation, and reporting.

## Task 3: Data Insights and Presentation

For this task, we leveraged visualizations to present our findings. We developed a Power BI dashboard that showcases data summaries and analysis results. Our presentation addressed key business questions, including:

- Trends in the underlying data
- Identification of customer segments with the highest customer value
- Proposed marketing and growth strategy recommendations for Sprocket Central Pty Ltd
